<p><font size="4" face="Garamond"><em>This web-site shows all of
my collection of Victorian hot water bottles and muff warmers. I
have been collecting these items since 2001. If you recognise any
of the items in the collection, I would be delighted to hear from
you with any details, e.g. date of manufacture, place of
manufacture etc.</em></font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Garamond"><em><strong>History:</strong></em></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Garamond"><em>About four
years ago I walked into a Restaurant called &quot;The
Huntsman&quot; in Dinas Powys near Cardiff in South Wales. This
is a great restaurant with the added extra of being run by a hot
water bottle fanatic. The restaurant is in a small barn
conversion with exposed beams running overhead. Every single
square inch of beam is covered in ceramic hot water bottles, foot
warmers and muff warmers. Muff warmers are small hand-held
ceramic hot water bottles that are mostly 18th Century as they
date to the time ladies used fur muffs, cloaks and carriages.
About six months later my Mother went to the same restaurant (The
owner was selling off lesser bottles from his collection) and
bought me my first hot water bottle as a Christmas present and
since then I have been tragically addicted to the accumulation of
hot water bottles.</em></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Garamond"><em>The Huntsman
represents the best collection I have seen although apparently
there is a three hundred bottle collection in North London. </em></font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="4" face="Garamond"><em>I buy quite a
few items from </em></font><a href="http://ebay.co.uk"
target="new"><font size="4" face="Garamond"><em>E-bay</em></font></a><font
size="4" face="Garamond"><em> on the Internet using the ID </em><strong>SPPOTS</strong><em>
and it appears that there are a few equally tragic collectors out
there (YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE). In the unlikely event you enjoy the
site and you have an item I am interested in then please, please,
please e-mail. </em>(</font><a href="mailto:sppots11@aol.com"
