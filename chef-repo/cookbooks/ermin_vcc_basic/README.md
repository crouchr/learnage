This cookbook is a useful example of running a dev 
and prod environment with correspondingly different inspec tests.

It also uses berksfile.

Basically a simple project that is 'close' to being a VCC cookbook project and can be used for minimal
environment for testing Chef concepts etc.

See 'Learning Chef' page 271 for correct command to create a cookbook folder structure, including Berksfile.
