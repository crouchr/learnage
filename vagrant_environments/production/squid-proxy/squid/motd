 CentOS7 / Squid v3.5.20

 Configured to allow Mars to access
 SSL-enabled sites (e.g. PyPI) due to
 Slackware 12.0 TLS issues

 NOTE : Vagrant install is currently broken
 You need to ssh in as vagrant/vagrant and then run the following under sudo
 # /usr/lib64/squid/ssl_crtd -c -s /var/lib/ssl_db

 And then
 # systemctl start squid.service
