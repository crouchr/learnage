# TODO

- add MySQl database on the node and write data to it
- add self-signed SSL certs 
- add modsec to protect WUI ?
- output alerts in JSON format - need 2.9 or above - not possible
- modify mars code to get tsom info to ossec - remove spurious fields before timestamp
- can PSAD be run on mars - there are ossec rules for it
- rename as blackrain-ossec if can get 3.x running
- see if can get running ossec+ very latest code and still works with mars (legacy)
- export as OVA and run on 32GB node as a pet
