- output alerts in JSON format - need 2.9 or above
- <logall> to archive agent logs
- GeoIP enhancement ? agent 2.7 or above should support this
- re-enable rootkit and syscheck on Server (slows down development)
- modify mars code to get tsom info to ossec - remove spurious fields before timestamp
- can PSAD be run on mars - there are ossec rules for it
- rename as blackrain-ossec if can get 3.x running
- see if can get running ossec+ very latest code and still works with mars (legacy)
- add WUI ?
- export as OVA and run on 32GB node as a pet

My own rules
